💺 Seat Preference: Select seat types (Window, Middle, Corner).
🌬️ Comfort Type: Choose between AC and Non-AC buses.
🚌 Travel Operators: Select from various bus travel companies.
🔑 OTP Verification: A random OTP is generated, and the user must verify it for successful booking.
📝 Booking Details Display: After OTP verification, the complete booking information is displayed.
