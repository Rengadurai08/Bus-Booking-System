🚌 Bus-Booking-System
This project is a Python-based Bus Booking System that demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to simulate a real-world booking process. The system allows users to provide personal information, select travel routes, choose seat preferences and bus comfort, and verify bookings through OTP authentication.

🚌 Travel Operators: Select from various bus travel companies.
🔑 OTP Verification: A random OTP is generated, and the user must verify it for successful booking.
📝 Booking Details Display: After OTP verification, the complete booking information is displayed.
